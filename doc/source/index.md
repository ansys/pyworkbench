Introduction
------------
PyWorkbench is part of the larger [PyAnsys](https://docs.pyansys.com/)
effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies directly from Python.
Its primary package, ``ansys-workbench-core``, provides framework for Python client
scripting for Ansys Workbench as a gRPC service.

PyWorkbench provides an environment where you can make use of the capabilities
of various PyAnsys modules for which the Ansys applications have been
integrated with Workbench.

Scripting
---------
On top of your existing IronPython-based Workbench scripts that still run on the
PyWorkbench server, the latest Python modules and technologies can be utilized in
any PyWorkbench client-side scripts.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation for the latest PyWorkbench is hosted at [PyWorkbench documentation](https://workbench.docs.pyansys.com/).


Feedback
--------
On the [PyWorkbench Issues](https://github.com/ansys/pyworkbench/issues) page,
you can create issues to report bugs and request new features.
